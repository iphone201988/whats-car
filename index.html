              In the fast-paced world of recruitment and relationships,
              understanding someone’s personality can be as essential as
              checking under the hood of a high-performance car. Inspired by
              Carl Jung’s research into psychological types, we have created a
              new spin on personality profiling, one that blends Jung’s deep
              insights with a modern new approach called (CAR) Characteristics,
              Attitude, and Results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine human personality as the engine that powers everything we
              do, with each person reflecting a different model of thinking,
              feeling, and acting. And just like with cars, you can tell a lot
              about someone by the way they drive through life. The CAR
              framework is rooted in Jung’s work, and applies to human
              personalities, with each personality type symbolized by an iconic
              vehicle. Because at the end of the day, we’re all navigating the
              twists and turns of life in our unique way.
